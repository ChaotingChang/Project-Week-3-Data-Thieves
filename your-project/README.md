<a name="hypotheses-/-questions"></a>

## Hypotheses / Questions
1. Is there a correlation between the happiness of a country and the voting polls of extreme political parties?
2. Do these countries invest more into internal matter -  specific sectors regional infrastructure and heritage?
        2.1 Within a single country - introspective
        2.2 In comparison to other countries in the European union – external comparison (extrospective)
**Look for: ** 
	- Trends over time
	- Countries of the European union
- Hypothesis1: There is a negative correlation between extremism (both left and right) and the happiness of a country
- Hypothesis 2: Countries which are happier and hold less extreme political views will invest more into regional development and heritage.
